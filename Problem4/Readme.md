The sequence of positive integers composed of N elements is given. Find its largest ascending sequence with the quadratic complexity algorithm.
Data to be entered: One integer N in the first row (1 <= N <= 100). In the next row, N is a positive integer, none of which has a value greater than 1000.
Output data: Largest ascending sequence length.
