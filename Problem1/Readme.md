The following two operations are performed for a natural number N: a) If the number is even, divide by 2. B) If the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add one. The same operation is then repeated on the received number until 1 is obtained after any operation. Write a program that displays all the numbers obtained during the process shown in the first row and the number of operations performed in the second.

Input data: One integer N (0 <N <30000).

Output Data: In the first row, display the sequence of numbers that will be obtained until the starting number becomes 1. In the second row, display one integer - the number of digits displayed in the first row.
